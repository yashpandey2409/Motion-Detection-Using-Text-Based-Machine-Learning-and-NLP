# Motion-Detection-Using-Text-Based-Machine-Learning-and-NLP
This project aims to develop an intelligent motion detection system using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Instead of relying on traditional video-based sensors, the system analyzes descriptive textual data to identify and predict motion events.
